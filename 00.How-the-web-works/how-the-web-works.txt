What is HTTP?

- HTTP is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.


When you type a wed address into your browser, what happens?

1. The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the websites's IP address.
2. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the request.
   This message and all other data sent between the client and the server is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets.
4. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you.


What's the order in which component files are parsed?

1. The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any <link> and any <script>.
2. As the browser parses the HTML file, it sends back requests to the server for any CSS files found from <link> elements, and any JavaScript files found in <script> elements. Then, the browser parses the CSS and JavaScript.
3. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.
4. As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user can see the page content and can begin to interact with it.
