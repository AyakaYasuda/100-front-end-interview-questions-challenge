What is an API?
- An application programming interface allows an application to communicate with other application.


What is REST?

- REpresentational State Transfer is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how APIs should work.
- APIs that follows the REST architecture style are called REST or RESTful APIs.
- To be a RESTful API, an API must adhere certain principals including:
    uniform interface
        - For example, request should identify resources by using URI.
    statelessness
        - The server completes every client's request independently.
    cacheablility
        - Clients can cache responses
    client-server
        - The interface is separated from the backend and data storage. This allows APIs to be flexible and scalable.


How do RESTful APIs work?

1. The client sends a request to the server.
2. The server authenticates the client and confirms that the client has the right to make that request.
3. The server receives the request and processes it internally.
4. The server returns a response to the client. The response contains information that tells the client whether the request was successful. It also contains information that the client requested.


What does the RESTful API client request contain?

1. URI: unique resources identifier - REST APIs typically uses URL and it specifies the path to the resource.
2. Method: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE - tell the server what it needs to do to the resource.
3. HTTP headers: metadata exchanged between the client and server. For example, it indicates the format of the request and response.
