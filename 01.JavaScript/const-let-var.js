/*

- const and var were introduced in ES6.
- The issue that they were trying to solve was that var was using lexical scope and it was causing variable hoisting.
- const and let use block scope.

=== let ===
1. cannot be re-declared
2. must be declared before use
3. have block scope

=== const ===
1. cannot be re-declared
2. cannot be re-assigned
3. have block scope
