How do you maintain states in your application?
- You can use the local storage where you can store key value pairs in the browser and get that out of the browser as well.
- There's also a way to store using cookies as session storage.

<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      const user = JSON.stringify({
        firstName: 'Dylan',
        lastName: 'Israel',
      });

      localStorage.setItem('user', user);

      console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')));
    </script>
  </head>
